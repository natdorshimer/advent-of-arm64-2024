# About

This is assembly code for solving the first advent of code problem, with an example python script of the solution in shorter format. Done in a personal project to get more experience with assembly. 

This will only run on MacOS with M1+. It uses the `arm64` architecture and some XNU darwin syscalls for files, so it won't work on other arm64 systems.
